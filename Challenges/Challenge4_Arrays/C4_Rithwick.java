/**
 * You are the teacher in a class of 4 students. Each student has 5 classes Math, Science, English, and 2 electives in a day and he gets a grade for all of them.
 * Your task is to automate the task of calculating the average grade for all the students and their rank. You know the grades for 2 students and you 
 * ask the user for input on the other two students. Then calculate their super score which is 
 *             English^2 + 2*(The greater betweeen Science and English) + SquareRoot of the minimum, between Science and English + 0.5(sum of electives)
 *             
 *             Rules:
 *                  1. Use sensible names
 *                  2. Use arrays, Scanner, Math class methods
 *                  4. Leave atleast 3 comments.
 *
