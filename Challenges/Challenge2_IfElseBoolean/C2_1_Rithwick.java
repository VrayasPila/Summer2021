/**
 * Since this challenge has multiple level, you can submit multiple files or the same file with clearly labeled parts for what code does what
 * 
 * C2.1: Write A Program that will input 2 numbers from the user and tell you iif the first number is divisible by the second number. 
 * Use what we did in class today. To input numbers impor the Scanner class, and use Scanner.nextInt() to input numbers. Refer to challenge 1 for syntax
 * 
 * C2.2: Write a simple calculator that accepts a number from the user and based on this number decides wether to add, subtract, mult, divide or give
 * the remainder. Then accept 2 number from the user and perform the requested operation
 * 
 * (Opional) C2.3: Write a program that tells me what numbers from 1 to 7 divide a certain number.
